<p>
 This module was written as helper tools for the mod_xconf (to expand abillities in point-to-point mode).<br>
 When there is a need to connect several separate hosts/networks between themselves (in point-to-point mode) but the situation disallows to use VPN or similar services.<br>

# Basic features
 - low latacy (good fit for RTP traffic)
 - passthrough mode to exchange traffic as-is
 - authentication and encryption traffic (based on RC4)
 - managing tunnels in real time (add, del, so on)
